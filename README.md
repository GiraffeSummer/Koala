# Koala

Koala is version 3 of Hikage, my discord bot I started years ago.  
I've had to redo most of the work, and in the end very happy I did.  
It now uses slash commands and all the other fancy new features like dropdowns, buttons and modals.   
The level system is now based on command usage, and does no longer log the levelup message due to API changes, but that's just how it is.


## todo:
- Put magic 8 ball results on image!  
- Proper licence

### Licence
I do not currently have a licence, but you're free to check out my code and use it for reference.
Do **not** redistribute, or sell.

I struggled a lot finding any good working examples of slash commands (at least of how I wanted to make them)  
So I do want to help out.
